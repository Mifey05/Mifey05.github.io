title: My First Encounter

My first proper encounter to programming codes isn't my own creation. rather, it's modifying a snippet from a .json file in Going Medieval. To "unlock the limit" of the character creation.
here's the snippet
{% highlight ruby %}
"creationPointRange" : {
    "min" : 1000,
    "max" : 10000
},
{% endhighlight %}

I never intended to disrespect the developer team behind this Early Access masterpiece of a game. however (of course there's a but), one's desire to cheat is unstoppable.

Shoutout to Foxy Voxel for making such an amazing game!
