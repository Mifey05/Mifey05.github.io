I'm gonna be completely transparent here, I didn't listen to jacksh- during the entire session. What I know, however, today is about the basics of functions and limits.

No, I don't get what that is. Not that I never heard of it, mind you. Just don't ask a forgetful person about the stuff that he wishes to forget the most.
As far as I know, a function is some sort of a structure, usually put into *f(x)*, the *f* being the output, while the *x* is the input. It substitutes all the *x* within the function, and that will equal to *f*. i.e, *f(x)= x2 - x*. Say, *x*=2. It'll then inserts itself into the function, turning it into *f*(2)=2(2)-2. Theoratically, it should stay consistent whatever the *x* is.
However, what about:
$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}
$$
Inserting *x=1* into the function, it'll result in 0/0, which is undefined. That's where *limit* comes in. limit asks the question, *what happens to f(x) as x approaches 1?* (instead of directly plugging *x*=1 in). *x* not being 1 cancels out the problem of 1-1. Overall, as *x* approaches 1, f(x) also approaches 2. Meaning, f(x)=2
So, essentially if substituting *x* directly causes *f(x)* being undefined, limit approximates the answer to the function.
