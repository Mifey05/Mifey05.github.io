title: Final week or Final's week?
---
Another final's project, and again with python.
Did you know that staring at your screen for too long can be unhealthy? Wow, what a shocking revelation.

Jokes aside, it's actually quite unhealthy to stare at your screen for long periods of time.

One of my final's project is to research a problem then make something that could help with the problem. My group made an app.
Of all the features, I made a reminder code that pops up every 30 and 60 minutes. It utilizes Tkinter's MessageBox, along with a bunch of other imports.
Here's the code if you're interested. Just run the code and it should theoratically pop up every 30 and 60 minutes.

``` Python
"""This is the runtime reminder module, set to 30 minutes and 1 hour"""
import threading
import time
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
from queue import Queue, Empty

class PopupManager:
    """Manages pop-ups to ensure only one is displayed at a time."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = Queue()
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.withdraw()  # Hide the main Tkinter window
        self.root.attributes("-topmost", True)  # Keep pop-ups on top
        self.is_showing = False  # Track if a pop-up is currently being displayed

        # Schedule queue processing
        self.process_queue()

    def process_queue(self):
        """Process the queue and show pop-ups sequentially."""
        if not self.is_showing:
            try:
                title, message = self.queue.get_nowait()
                self.is_showing = True
                messagebox.showinfo(title, message)
                self.is_showing = False
            except Empty:
                pass
        self.root.after(100, self.process_queue)  # Check the queue every 100ms

    def add_popup(self, title, message):
        """Add a new pop-up to the queue."""
        self.queue.put((title, message))

    def start(self):
        """Start the Tkinter main loop."""
        self.root.mainloop()


class Runtime:

    def __init__(self, popup_manager):

        start_time1 = time.time()
        start_time2 = time.time()
        while not self.stop_flag.is_set():
            runtime1 = time.time() - start_time1
            runtime2 = time.time() - start_time2

            # Check if the first interval has passed
            if runtime1 >= self.interval1:
                self.popup_manager.add_popup("Reminder", "It's been 30 minutes! Take a quick break.")
                start_time1 = time.time()  # Reset the first timer

        self.thread = threading.Thread(target=self.reminder_task, daemon=True)
        self.thread.start()

    def stop(self):
        """Stops the reminder thread."""
        self.stop_flag.set()
        self.thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    popup_manager = PopupManager()
