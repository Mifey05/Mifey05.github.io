title: "What are you assembling for?"

If you've read my previous post on my RPS project, you may think
> wow, this mifey guy know quite a lot about python to make a whole game, albeit a basic game. What more could he do?

I'm gonna put that as a famous last words lol.

Another piece we're "taught" is Assembly. On the one hand, sure another piece to our list of knowledge. but as my friend said,
> We're taught how to climb stairs and are told to climb a cliff

Here's the icing on the cake for our suffering. The assignment must be solved in an online 8086 emulator that my lecturer chose. Why? Because it's a rather obscure version that chatGPT can't help you with. Fortunately for me, I got a random personal enlightenment that allowed me to solve mine. Let's take for example, the final assignment for this semester for this subject.

It took me less than 10 minutes after I got the pattern to make the code. Am i fine? Perhaps

The following is the code, you can try running it on [This](https://yjdoc2.github.io/8086-emulator-web/compile) to test it yourself.
```Assembly
start: ; marks the beginning of the code
mov cx, 14 ; determines the byte length of the output
mov ah, 0x13 ; primes the next interrupt to print strings
mov al, 0x2a ; moves asterisk into al
mov bh, 0x20 ; moves space into bh
mad: ; label for the loop to insert elements into the memory
cmp bl, 7 ; checks if the loop has reached 7 iteration, changes the relevant flags
je nope ; "jump if equal" takes the previous flag changes
inc bl ; increases bl by 1 to mark the loop iterations
mov byte ds[bp], al ; write asterisk from al into memory pointed by base pointer
inc bp ; increases bp by 1 so the next write doesn't overwrite the previous write
mov byte ds[bp], bh ; write space from bh into memory pointed by base pointer
inc bp ; increases bp by 1 for the purpose of the next loop iteration, see line 11
jmp mad ; forcefully jump back to "mad"
nope: ; label for the initialization of the next stage
mov bp, 0 ; resets base pointer back to 0 to prepare for printing
AGAIN: ; label for the first stage of the print loop
int 0x10 ; BIOS interrupt, made by al to print strings
sub cx, 2 ; reduce the byte length printed by 2 to account for the space in the memory
cmp bl, 1 ; compares bl to 1, making use of the previous usage of bl to check the loop iteration
je uhh ; "jump if equal", taking the previous flag changes by compare
dec bl ; decreases bl by 1 to mark the loop iterations
add dl, 2 ; increase dl by 2, moving the collumn position for the output print
jmp AGAIN ; forcefully jump back to "AGAIN"
uhh: ; label for the initialization of the second stage of the print loop
sub dl, 2 ; moves the collumn position back by 2, again accounting for the space
inc cx ; increases the byte length of the output print
secAGAIN: ; label for the second stage of the print loop
add cx, 2 ; increases the byte length by 2, accounting for the space
int 0x10 ; BIOS interrupt, made by al to print strings
sub dl, 2 ; moves thee collumn position back by 2
cmp bl, 6 ; compares bl to 6, reversing the usage of bl to check for loop iteration
je end ; "jump if equal", taking previous flag changes by compare
inc bl ; increases bl by 1 to mark the loop iteration
jmp secAGAIN ; forcefully jumps back to "secAGAIN"
end: ; label that marks the end of the program
hlt ; halt executions, ending the program
```
