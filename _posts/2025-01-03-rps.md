title: "Rock Paper What?"
---

Have you ever had an itch to make a game of your own? I certainly did. That's why I'm majoring in Application Development. However, i don't have the proper skill to do so at this current point in time.
So, what could possibly be able to remedy this? Creating one with the skills I have currently, and that is Python. Granted, it's not my own desire pushing me, it's an assignment.

For ideas, I go with a basic Rock Paper Scissors. The catch? The "bot" is programmed to be rather... unique. Well, it's just lines of codes, but check out what it'll say when i misinput something.

Neat, don't you think?
Yet that's not all. The program included musics implemented using PyGames. You can also choose between battling the aforementioned bot or battle another human being, if you have friends to play with. You start by choosing how many rounds you'd like to play, then choosing who you're fighting with. Trust me, it's not complicated. There's only around 263 lines of code. I'm sure someone could create a more efficient program, but i don't care. Here's the entire code.

```python
import random
import time
import pygame
import os

pygame.mixer.init()
sbgm = "Bg.mp3"
sgo = "Go.mp3"
spvp = "pvp.mp3"
bgm = pygame.mixer.Sound(sbgm)
go = pygame.mixer.Sound(sgo)
pvp = pygame.mixer.Sound(spvp)

print("\033c")
while True:
    prog = 1
    scoreb = 0
    scorep = 0
    while True:
        print("Note: This code is not optimized for longer games. Expect bugs")
        rnd = input("How many rounds would you like to play? ")
        if rnd.isdigit():
            tem = input(f"You've entered {rnd} rounds, are you sure? (y/n) ")
            if tem == "y":
                print("Then let's proceed!\n")
                break
            elif tem == "n":
                print("Alright, let's try this again.\n")
            else:
                print("Perhaps contemplate about visiting a psychiatrist for that misinput.\n")
        else:
            print("Please enter a valid number.\n")

    while True:
        choice = input("Would you like to play against a bot or another human? (1 for bot, 2 for human) ")
        if choice == "1":
            print("Alright, you'll be fighting against me then. Let's go!\n")
            break
        elif choice == "2":
            print("Ight bet! Hope you're not playing this alone.\n")
