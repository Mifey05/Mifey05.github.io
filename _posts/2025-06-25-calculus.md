Let's check... After _limit_, the next subject is on *derivative* and *integral*.
Derivative and integral came about because Newton seeked to find a calculation that could find "rate of change" and "accumulation" respectively. The way the two connect to each other is that,
> Derivatives undo integrals, integrals accumulate derivatives.

The most basic of the formulas for each is as the following,

Derivative:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This formula gives the **instantaneous rate of change** (slope) of a function at point \( x \).

Integral:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i)\,\Delta x
$$

This formula computes the **total accumulated value** of \( f(x) \) from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \), often visualized as the **area under the curve**.

Imagine an acceleration of a car from 0 to 100 in 2 seconds. Derivative calculates the car's acceleration at an exact point within those 2 seconds, i.e at 1 second.
Basing it form that analogy,
Derivative calculates the car's acceleration ($$ a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} $$)
Integral calculates the car's velocity which is the accumulation of the car's acceleration ($$ v(t) = \int a(t)\,dt $$)
Integral also calculates the distance from the accumulation of the car's velocity ($$ s(t) = \int v(t)\,dt $$)
So while the derivative zooms in, the integral zooms out to see what all that change adds up to.

This is, of course, a very basic summary. There is a lot more to it than what you see here, but that's way above my paygrade, literally and figuratively, because i don't even know what half of these are talking about.
